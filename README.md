__Name:__ Alexander Gabriel A. Aranes

__Section:__ CMSC 100 C-3L

__Program Description:__ In the `index.js` file, there are three functions that works together on validating user credentials. It checks for the valid length, character case, and included numbers. The credentials given by the user are stored in an object. All valid passwords are reversed.

__Key Takeaways:__ Most important take away from this exercise is the familizarization with the syntax and implementation of different algorithms using JavaScript. The exercise provided a set of problems to solve which allows the programmers to re-learn and learn more about different methods or functions that javascript provides for solving. An example of this is the iteration. The `forEach()` method of arrays can be implemented in other ways but it also provides other opportunities and syntactic sugar.
